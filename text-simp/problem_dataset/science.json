After the drought ended, the U.S. government encouraged farmers to change their farming practices to prevent this from happening again. Which practice would best help the soil stay in place? A. planting only natural grasses and corn in the fields B. planting soybeans and corn in fields next to fields with cattle C. planting trees and grasses in areas between fields with crops D. building pipelines to carry large amounts of water to use in sprinklers in the fields",
